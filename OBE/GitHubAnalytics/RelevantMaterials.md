* Title: [Network Structure of Social Coding on Github](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CB0QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mysmu.edu%2Ffaculty%2Flxjiang%2Fpapers%2Fcsmr13github.pdf&ei=Pn_iU-jyNu7MsQTHg4I4&usg=AFQjCNGlIbmZ8QptKGG3zVuaimqAufy4xA&bvm=bv.72197243,d.cWc)  

Relevance: Directly analyzes GitHub data via API to deminstrate network structures of the relationships of people. The network structure of people is one of the key views used by Human Dynamics to reveal underlying models and systems.  It will likely be relevant to seeing propegation of skills through the networks of people who teach or otherwise influence each other with new coding methods, languages or other practices.  The social coding network structure may also reveal deeper patterns of innovation and entreprenuership. 


* Title: [TransactiveDB: Tapping into Collective Human Memories](http://exascale.info/papers/TransactiveDB.pdf)  

Relevance: 
Michele Catasta from EPFL aims to create a transactive memory search tool w/in the GitHub. This tool can be generated in conjunction with our plan to perform analytics on GitHub API data - specifically issue ticket data. One goal will be to implement a web-based application w/in GitHub that can direct automatically and iteratively direct issue tickets from the person with an information need to the individual who contains that information in memory and can best respond. This tool will rely upon GitHub Network structure data to atuomatically, iteratively, and scalably drive issue tickets to the persons or people best suited to comment on the issue ticket. 

Secondly, we could use the transactive approach to our benefit when the data simply is not there and we need to rely upon people's memories. We can use the transactive approach to reconstruct high-level actions on codebases, reconstruct how skills propogated according to collective memory, etc. Here is an example: when code goes through a major refactoring, it is rarely documented why, and what series of choices brought to that decision. Not only we could reconstruct what happened and why, but we might find also useful correlations like "when there is social collaboration, a project undergoes X% more refactorings than one without collaboration", etc. What's more, we could even use the transactive approach to reconstruct how certain skills propogated based on collective memory; this way, in addition to the data we collect on how skills propogate, we could also compile a useful dataset based on collective memory.

# Michele Catasta and MIT Human Dynamics Lab

Michele Catasta presented to the Human Dynamics resarch team this summer.  His presence at the Media Lab may be a good opportunity to explore potential collaboration.  Following up, Nader took the initiative to have a brainstorming meting with Michele on August 12 about potential collaboration.  The following notes reflect Nader's write up.  


# Relevance of Research and Project Approaches

Michele Catasta from EPFL aims to create a transactive memory search tool w/in the GitHub. This tool can be generated in conjunction with our plan to perform analytics on GitHub API data - specifically issue ticket data. One goal will be to implement a web-based application w/in GitHub that can direct automatically and iteratively direct issue tickets from the person with an information need to the individual who contains that information in memory and can best respond. This tool will rely upon GitHub Network structure data to atuomatically, iteratively, and scalably drive issue tickets to the persons or people best suited to comment on the issue ticket.

Secondly, we could use the transactive approach to our benefit when the data simply is not there and we need to rely upon people's memories. We can use the transactive approach to reconstruct high-level actions on codebases, reconstruct how skills propogated according to collective memory, etc. Here is an example: when code goes through a major refactoring, it is rarely documented why, and what series of choices brought to that decision. Not only we could reconstruct what happened and why, but we might find also useful correlations like "when there is social collaboration, a project undergoes X% more refactorings than one without collaboration", etc. What's more, we could even use the transactive approach to reconstruct how certain skills propogated based on collective memory; this way, in addition to the data we collect on how skills propogate, we could also compile a useful dataset based on collective memory.

## Further Background

* Email to Michele from transactiveDB

Transactive DB functions as an automated and iterative system that can push queries to the person most appropriate for answering the query. It leverages transaction data to push queries to the asker's most relevant potential answerer. As I see it, this can be very useful as a function within the GitHub API - i.e. a system that pushes issue tickets to the most relevant answering party based on transaction data, AND analytics that our group plans to perform with GitHub and O*Net

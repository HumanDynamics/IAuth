My email to Michele from transactiveDB:

Transactive DB functions as an automated and iterative system that can push queries to the person most appropriate for answering the query. It leverages transaction data to push queries to the asker's most relevant potential answerer. As I see it, this can be very useful as a function within the GitHub API - i.e. a system that pushes issue tickets to the most relevant answering party based on transaction data, AND analytics that our group plans to perform with GitHub and O*Net

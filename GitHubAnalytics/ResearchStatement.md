Let us write up a research statement here for this exploratory GitHub analytics jam session.

To get us started, below is the substantive content from the email I sent on August 5th:

"Basically, the idea is to look at whether or how propagation of skills can be tracked with reference to the GitHub API.  For skills and occupation coding and data, check out: http://www.onetonline.org/   I am starting a close look at GitHub's support of deep tracking and reports for agile project management for opportunities to conduct other types of analytics including computational social science.  If you have not seen it, check out: https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/ and https://developer.github.com/v3/orgs/    Based on relationships with GitHub I believe I can gain access to some really hot GitHub data (the rate limit sucks when you hit the API cold off the street).  Consider the potential to see how team identify, rundown and solve errors and others problems based on GitHub issues (the ticketing system for bugs, etc) and compare that to the really rough (and apparently incorrect) estimation of troubleshooting by software developers listed at: http://www.onetonline.org/find/descriptor/result/2.B.3.k?a=1  (troubleshooting is what developers do all day long... and it can be revealed in new highly dimensional ways using combinations of GitHub and other online API sources .... eg contributions to Stack Overflow, etc).  

I'm interested to go through the GitHub API and formulate a research plan.  Based on that, I'll get access to the data (as much as I can) and ask Sandy about the best ways to collaborate.  If nothing else, the exercise of running through the API and testing some stuff will be educational, enriching and creatively stimulating.  And really fun!"
